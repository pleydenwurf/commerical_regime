To configure OpenGrok to use OpenID Connect authentication with Keycloak using Ansible, you'll need to modify the OpenGrok configuration and potentially install additional components. Here's how to approach this:

## Prerequisites

First, ensure you have:
- A Keycloak realm configured with an OpenID Connect client for OpenGrok
- The client credentials (client ID and secret) from Keycloak
- Network connectivity between OpenGrok and Keycloak

## Ansible Playbook Structure

Here's an Ansible playbook to configure OpenGrok with Keycloak OIDC:Now, let's create the necessary template files:## Keycloak Client Configuration

Before running the Ansible playbook, you need to configure a client in Keycloak:

1. **Create a new client in your Keycloak realm:**
   - Client ID: `opengrok-client`
   - Client Protocol: `openid-connect`
   - Access Type: `confidential`
   - Valid Redirect URIs: `https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com/callback`
   - Web Origins: `https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com`

2. **Configure client scopes and mappers:**
   - Add `email`, `profile`, and `groups` scopes
   - Create a group membership mapper to include user groups in tokens

## Inventory File

Create an inventory file (`inventory.yml`):

```yaml
all:
  children:
    opengrok_servers:
      hosts:
        opengrok-vm:
          ansible_host: your-opengrok-vm-ip
          ansible_user: your-ssh-user
      vars:
        opengrok_version: "1.7.44"  # Adjust to your version
```

## Vault File for Secrets

Create an encrypted vault file for sensitive data:

```bash
ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault.yml
```

Add the Keycloak client secret:
```yaml
vault_keycloak_client_secret: "your-actual-client-secret-from-keycloak"
```

## Running the Playbook

Execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml opengrok-keycloak.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

## Additional Considerations

1. **SSL/TLS**: Ensure both OpenGrok and Keycloak are running over HTTPS for security
2. **Firewall**: Make sure the OpenGrok server can reach Keycloak on the required ports
3. **Groups/Roles**: Configure appropriate group mappings in Keycloak that correspond to your OpenGrok authorization requirements
4. **Testing**: Test the authentication flow thoroughly after deployment
5. **Backup**: The playbook includes backup options for critical configuration files

This configuration assumes you're using a relatively recent version of OpenGrok that supports OIDC authentication. If you're using an older version, you might need to implement a custom authentication filter or consider upgrading OpenGrok first.

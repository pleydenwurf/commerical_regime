This version—where Apache is configured as a reverse proxy using mod_auth_openidc to enable Keycloak (OIDC) authentication for OpenGrok—is the correct and recommended approach!

Why this works:

OpenGrok itself does not support OIDC authentication natively.
Apache (with mod_auth_openidc) is a well-supported way to add OIDC authentication in front of web apps like OpenGrok.
The playbook:
Installs Apache and mod_auth_openidc.
Sets up an Apache virtual host (template assumed to configure OIDC and reverse proxy to Tomcat/OpenGrok).
Secures OpenGrok by binding Tomcat only to localhost.
Handles SSL, permissions, and service state.
Checks Apache config before enabling.
Best practices shown:

Only allows access to OpenGrok through the authenticated proxy.
Uses variables and templates for flexibility.
Has steps for SSL and permissions.
Includes config testing.
What you need to ensure:

Your opengrok-oidc.conf.j2 template correctly configures mod_auth_openidc and proxying.
Keycloak client is configured with correct redirect URIs (matching your Apache HTTPS endpoint).
The Tomcat/OpenGrok backend is not directly accessible from outside.
You have the correct client secret/ID and Keycloak realm info.
Summary:
This approach is secure, maintainable, and aligns with best practices for integrating OIDC with applications that don’t have native support. If you want an example Apache config or more guidance on the opengrok-oidc.conf.j2 template, let me know!

does this opengrok-oidc.conf.j2 look ok?

Your opengrok-oidc.conf.j2 template is well-structured and follows best practices for securing OpenGrok behind Apache with Keycloak OIDC authentication:

Key strengths:

HTTP to HTTPS redirection ensures secure access.
SSL configuration uses variables, making it flexible.
Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) are included.
OIDC settings (provider metadata, client ID/secret, redirect, logout, etc.) are correctly templated and comprehensive.
Sessions, claims, and user headers are handled robustly.
Reverse proxy is set up to only expose OpenGrok via Apache.
Authentication enforced for all content except explicit public endpoints (/health, static assets).
Public health endpoint for monitoring.
Logout is cleanly redirected to Keycloak logout.
Static assets exemption is optional and may improve UX/performance.
Suggestions/considerations:

OIDCRedirectURI:
Ensure your Keycloak client’s redirect URI matches https://your-fqdn/oidc_redirect.
Headers:
You’re passing user info as headers—ensure your OpenGrok deployment can log or utilize these if needed.
Static Assets:
The <LocationMatch> for static assets is a good touch. If you want full protection, you can remove or tighten it.
Crypto Passphrase:
Make sure to set a strong, secret value for oidc_crypto_passphrase in production.
ProxyPreserveHost:
This is correct for most cases, but verify OpenGrok works as expected behind the proxy.
Testing:
After applying this, test login/logout, user info headers, and public endpoints.
Summary:
This template is ready for production with just minor adjustments and thorough testing. It’s a robust and secure way to deploy OpenGrok behind Keycloak/OIDC.

If you need an example Keycloak client configuration or want to tighten/relax authentication for certain paths, let me know!

Correct Approach Summary
You're absolutely right. OpenGrok doesn't have a built-in OIDC plugin. The standard approaches are:
1. Apache with mod_auth_openidc (Recommended)

Most common and well-documented approach
mod_auth_openidc handles all OIDC complexity
OpenGrok receives user info via HTTP headers
Easy to configure and maintain

2. Nginx with lua-resty-openidc

Alternative for Nginx environments
Requires Lua support in Nginx
More complex setup but very flexible

3. Keycloak Gatekeeper (Deprecated)

Previously popular but now deprecated
Replaced by Keycloak's newer solutions

Keycloak Client Configuration
For either approach, configure your Keycloak client with:
Client ID: opengrok-client
Client Protocol: openid-connect
Access Type: confidential
Valid Redirect URIs: 
  - https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com/oidc_redirect (Apache)
  - https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com/redirect_uri (Nginx)
Standard Flow Enabled: ON
Key Benefits of This Approach:

No OpenGrok modifications needed - OpenGrok runs unchanged
Security handled at proxy level - Authentication happens before requests reach OpenGrok
User information passed via headers - OpenGrok can access user details through X-Forwarded-* headers
SSL termination - Proxy handles HTTPS
Session management - Proxy manages OIDC sessions

The Apache approach with mod_auth_openidc is generally recommended due to its maturity and extensive documentation.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4

If you already have an Apache instance running as a reverse proxy in front of Tomcat (which serves OpenGrok), not everything in the provided Ansible script is required. Here’s what you need vs. what you can skip:

What’s Only Needed If Not Already Present
Apache installation:
If Apache is already installed and running, you can skip installation steps.
Tomcat installation & management:
If Tomcat is already running OpenGrok, you don’t need to manage Tomcat’s installation or service via this script (unless you want Ansible to do it for consistency).
What You Still Need To Do
mod_auth_openidc installation:
You’ll need to install and enable the libapache2-mod-auth-openidc module if it isn’t already enabled.
Apache module enabling:
Ensure the necessary Apache modules are enabled: ssl, proxy, proxy_http, headers, rewrite, and auth_openidc.
Apache site configuration:
You must deploy (and enable) a site config like opengrok-oidc.conf (or integrate its contents into your existing Apache config) to:
Set up OIDC with Keycloak
Proxy requests to Tomcat/OpenGrok
Enforce authentication
SSL certificate:
If your existing Apache instance already has SSL configured for your OpenGrok domain, you don’t need to create or copy new certificates. Just reference them in your site config.
Tomcat binding:
It is a security best practice to ensure Tomcat only listens on localhost. If you’ve already done this, you can skip that step.
Restart services:
You’ll still need to reload/restart Apache after updating configs.
What You Can Skip If Already Present
Creating Apache directories
Disabling the default Apache site (if you already have your custom config in use)
Creating self-signed certificates (if you already have valid SSL)
Creating SSL certificate directory/permissions (if already set up)
Starting/enabling Tomcat/Apache (if already managed elsewhere)
Summary Table
Task	Needed if Already Have Apache+Tomcat?
Install Apache	No
Install Tomcat	No
Install mod_auth_openidc	Yes (if not already installed)
Enable required Apache modules	Yes (if not already enabled)
Deploy Apache OIDC site config	Yes
Configure SSL certificates in Apache site config	Only if not already configured
Ensure Tomcat binds only to localhost	Yes (if not already done)
Restart/reload Apache	Yes
Bottom Line:
If your Apache already proxies to OpenGrok and handles SSL, you mainly need to:

Install and enable mod_auth_openidc
Create/update your Apache site config to add OIDC authentication for OpenGrok
Restart Apache
You can skip installation and generic setup tasks that are already complete. Let me know if you want a concise checklist or an example of just the essential changes!

________________________________________________________

You're absolutely right to question this! If Tomcat is already running under Apache (likely via mod_jk or mod_proxy_ajp), you don't need a second Apache instance. You can configure OIDC authentication directly in your existing Apache setup.

Let me provide a corrected approach that works with your existing Apache+Tomcat setup:## Key Points for Your Existing Apache+Tomcat Setup:

### 1. **No Second Apache Instance Needed**
You're absolutely correct - you just need to:
- Install `libapache2-mod-auth-openidc` package
- Enable the `auth_openidc` module
- Modify your existing virtual host configuration

### 2. **Works with Existing Tomcat Integration**
Whether you're using:
- **mod_jk** with AJP connector
- **mod_proxy_ajp** 
- **mod_proxy_http**

The OIDC authentication layer sits in front of your existing Tomcat integration.

### 3. **Simple Configuration Steps**
```bash
# Install the module
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-auth-openidc

# Enable required modules
sudo a2enmod auth_openidc headers rewrite

# Modify your existing virtual host config
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-opengrok-site.conf

# Test and restart
sudo apache2ctl configtest
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 4. **User Information Flow**
1. User hits Apache
2. Apache handles OIDC authentication via mod_auth_openidc
3. Apache sets headers with user info (`X-Forwarded-User`, etc.)
4. Apache forwards request to Tomcat (your existing setup)
5. OpenGrok receives the request with user headers

### 5. **Keycloak Client Configuration**
Set the redirect URI to: `https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com/oidc_redirect`

This approach leverages your existing Apache+Tomcat setup and just adds the OIDC authentication layer on top. Much simpler than running two web servers!

_____________________________________________________
This playbook is well-suited for adding Keycloak OIDC authentication to an existing Apache and Tomcat setup running OpenGrok. Here’s why it matches your use case and what you should check:

What This Playbook Does Well
Does not reinstall Apache or Tomcat.
Only installs/enables the necessary modules (mod_auth_openidc, headers, rewrite).
Edits your existing Apache site configuration (using blockinfile), so it integrates with your current setup.
Backs up your original Apache config before changes.
Adds OIDC config and protects OpenGrok with authentication (in the <Location /> block).
Handles OIDC callback, logout, and optional public/static endpoints.
Performs an Apache configtest and shows the result.
Restarts Apache only if needed.
What You Still Need to Check/Do
Set apache_site_name variable if your enabled site is not the default (000-default-ssl).
Example:
YAML
-e "apache_site_name=your-opengrok-site"
Ensure SSL is already configured in your Apache site, since this playbook does not handle SSL certs.
If you have custom locations or proxy settings for Tomcat/OpenGrok, ensure they are not inadvertently overwritten by this playbook.
Test that the OIDC callback endpoint (/oidc_redirect) matches your Keycloak client settings.
Verify your Tomcat instance is only accessible via Apache for security.
Set a strong oidc_crypto_passphrase.
Summary
Yes, this playbook is correct and safe for your scenario.
It’s designed to be a “layer” on top of an existing Apache+Tomcat+OpenGrok stack.
It minimizes disruption and only changes what’s needed for OIDC.
Backups and config tests are included for safety.

__________________________________________________________
Here’s what you’d change/add to your existing preapache_oidc.yml playbook:

1. Add Variables for SSL Cert and Key Paths
Add variables at the top for certificate and key file locations, for example:

YAML
apache_ssl_cert: "/etc/ssl/certs/opengrok.crt"
apache_ssl_key: "/etc/ssl/private/opengrok.key"
2. (Optional) Add Tasks to Deploy SSL Certificate and Key
If you want Ansible to copy certificate files (instead of you placing them manually):

YAML
- name: Copy SSL certificate
  copy:
    src: "files/opengrok.crt"
    dest: "{{ apache_ssl_cert }}"
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'

- name: Copy SSL private key
  copy:
    src: "files/opengrok.key"
    dest: "{{ apache_ssl_key }}"
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0600'
Or, if you use Let’s Encrypt, you could reference /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem and privkey.pem.

3. Ensure Apache SSL Module Is Enabled
Add ssl to the modules enabled:

YAML
- name: Enable required Apache modules
  apache2_module:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - ssl
    # (other modules)
4. Update Apache Site Configuration for SSL
Edit your Apache site config (the .conf file you’re modifying via Ansible) to ensure it has a <VirtualHost *:443> block similar to:

apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName {{ ansible_fqdn }}
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile {{ apache_ssl_cert }}
    SSLCertificateKeyFile {{ apache_ssl_key }}
    # ... rest of your OIDC config and proxy settings ...
</VirtualHost>
If you use Ansible’s blockinfile, you can add a block for the SSL directives if not present.

5. (Optional) Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
You may want to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Add this to your port 80 <VirtualHost> or as a block in your config:

apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName {{ ansible_fqdn }}
    Redirect permanent / https://{{ ansible_fqdn }}/
</VirtualHost>
6. Reload/Restart Apache
This is already handled by your playbook when config changes occur.

Summary of Changes Needed
Add/define variables for cert and key paths
Add (optional) tasks to deploy cert and key files
Enable Apache ssl module
Ensure your Apache config has SSL directives in the proper <VirtualHost *:443> block, referencing your cert and key
(Optional) Add HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection
Test with apache2ctl configtest and reload Apache

Heres a snippet to add to copy certificates if needed.
- name: Copy SSL certificate to Apache
  copy:
    src: files/opengrok.crt
    dest: /etc/ssl/certs/opengrok.crt
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'

- name: Copy SSL private key to Apache
  copy:
    src: files/opengrok.key
    dest: /etc/ssl/private/opengrok.key
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0600'


How to use:

Place your certificate (opengrok.crt) and key (opengrok.key) in the files/ directory of your Ansible project.
Adjust the dest paths if your Apache expects them in different locations.
Make sure your Apache SSL config references these paths:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/opengrok.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/opengrok.key

Tip:
Add these tasks before your Apache config/enable/restart steps, so the files are in place before Apache reloads.

You're correct! With the most recent versions of OpenGrok (1.7.x and later), you don't need to use pac4j for OIDC authentication. OpenGrok now has built-in support for OpenID Connect authentication.

Let me update the configuration to reflect the current OpenGrok OIDC implementation:Now let me create a simpler, more accurate configuration template for the modern OpenGrok OIDC setup:You're absolutely right! With modern OpenGrok (1.7.x and later), the OIDC authentication is built-in and much simpler to configure. Here are the key differences:

## What's Changed in Modern OpenGrok:

1. **No pac4j dependency** - OpenGrok now has native OIDC support
2. **Built-in OIDC plugin** - Uses `org.opengrok.indexer.authorization.plugins.OidcPlugin`
3. **Configuration through XML** - All OIDC settings go in the main `configuration.xml`
4. **Simplified setup** - No need for custom filters or additional JARs

## Key Configuration Points:

1. **Redirect URI**: Modern OpenGrok uses `/api/v1/auth/callback` as the callback endpoint
2. **Plugin-based**: Authentication is handled through the plugin system
3. **Direct XML configuration**: OIDC settings are configured directly in the main configuration file

## Keycloak Client Setup:

Make sure your Keycloak client has:
- **Valid Redirect URIs**: `https://your-opengrok-server.domain.com/api/v1/auth/callback`
- **Access Type**: `confidential`
- **Client Protocol**: `openid-connect`
- **Standard Flow Enabled**: `ON`

The simplified approach means you don't need to worry about pac4j dependencies, custom authentication filters, or complex web.xml modifications. The built-in OIDC plugin handles everything through the standard OpenGrok configuration system.
